# ASSIGNMENT

For my semester project in computer science during the first semester, I created a program called **Matboj**.  
The abbreviation *Matboj* stands for **Matrix Battle**. This program is designed for working with matrices.  

## Features  
Using this program, you can:  

✅ Add matrices  
✅ Subtract matrices  
✅ Multiply matrices  
✅ Create an inverse matrix  
✅ Calculate the determinant of a matrix  
✅ Create a transposed matrix  
✅ Compute the rank of matrices  

## Data Input Methods  
The program allows data input through two methods:  

1. **Generating random numbers** (using `rnd`)  
2. **Manual input from the keyboard** (using `Scanner`)  

## Development Environment  
For this project, I use **BlueJ** development environment, which is based on the Java platform.
